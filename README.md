#LEARNING EXPERIENCE (view this section in code -> more organised)

project 1--python encryptor-decryptor : received help and inspiration from https://youtu.be/vsLBErLWBhA?si=wYohhAwvfkEZxQQl
   -learning points :
         ->the debugging process was tedious but it ultimately allowed me to obtain analytic thinking -->while coding/debugging, i was wondering what part of it unabled me to run it normally.
         ->how to search for solutions online -->forums, trusted websites, youtube tutorials etc.
         ->i created this project as i feel that by creating such projects involving security elements such as encryption, i am able to get hands-on experience (very beginner) in the cybersecurity field.
         ->this project allowed me to explore more functions in python through hands-on projects and expand my knowledge in the coding language.
