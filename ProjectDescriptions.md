#LEARNING EXPERIENCE (view this section in code -> more organised)

project 1--python encryptor-decryptor : received help and inspiration from https://youtu.be/vsLBErLWBhA?si=wYohhAwvfkEZxQQl
   -learning points :
         >the debugging process was tedious but it ultimately allowed me to obtain analytic thinking -->while coding/debugging, i was wondering what part of it unabled me to run it normally.
         >how to search for solutions online -->forums, trusted websites, youtube tutorials etc.
         >i created this project as i feel that by creating such projects involving security elements such as encryption, i am able to get hands-on experience (very beginner) in the cybersecurity field.
         >this project allowed me to explore more functions in python through hands-on projects and expand my knowledge in the coding language.
         
project 2--login page : coded it myself with help only from searching on google
 -learning points :
         >critical thinking : how would I structure the layout of the code, how would I design the login page code in such a way that it obeys security guidelines
         >debugging : In this project, I implemented "while" loops and "elif" logic statements, which was a challenge to debug as they were a foreign concept to me at the time, but over time I understood the concepts.
         >I created this project as a way to step into the world of cybersecurity as I noticed that the login page that we see daily on our social media accounts or other accounts is something that implements the 
          concept of security.
         >I enjoyed coding this project as it allowed me to experience trial and error which I ultimately learnt more about the Python coding language, as well as the concept of security in login pages we find in websites.
          
project 3--guessthenumber : messed around with logic and random() functions
-learning points:
         >entry-level for random() functions
         >allowed me to really think what could be made to improve the game(how to make it more fun by increasing number upper limit etc.)

project 4--brute force password guesser : hands-on experience on what hacking could be like (brute force guessing passwords)
-learning points:
         >arrangement of logic code blocks
         >patience is key (took quite some time to get it working as I intended it to)
         >it is inefficient to brute force passwords if they many characters are included
